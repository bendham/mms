# Matthews Messaging Service

Don't like Discord any more? Say Hello to MMS. The next generation of communication...(yes, totally is). As a Client, connect to the hosted server and create a room! Or maybe
you even want to join your friends! Send voice audio or even text messages.

Host the Server if you want to make your own Server! Just ensure you update the specified IP in the Client file!

## Disclaimer 

This code is still in development. As well, this was coded during a time of learning how to properly code. (I mean I still am, when does the learning end!?)
